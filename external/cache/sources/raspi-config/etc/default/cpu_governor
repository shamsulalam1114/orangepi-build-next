#
# ondemand governor: This defines what the average CPU usage between the
# samplings of 'sampling_rate' needs to be for the kernel to make a decision
# on whether it should increase the frequency.

#

#
# ondemand governor: How often you want the kernel to look at the CPU usage
# and to make decisions on what to do about the frequency.

# ondemand governor: The rate at which the kernel makes a decision on when to
# decrease the frequency while running at top speed
